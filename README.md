<h4>
    This is the beginnings of a blog using Lumen, a minimal, lightweight and mobile-first starter for creating blogs using <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>. I'll update this as I see fit, right now it's just a playground.

<p>
Check out the original repo <a href="https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen">here</a>, I'll be tweaking the design a bit but it's a beautiful start that I'd recommend to everyone.
